name: hub-health
description: "Health check of agent-hub/: size (read every session vs cold storage, archive flags), real billed tokens per main session / verifier / analyst from Claude Code transcripts, spawn cost, and token waste (re-reads, failing-command loops, oversized tool output). Usage: /hub-health [days] [--report <agent-hub-init path>]. Read-only on this project; --report writes one report file into agent-hub-init's improvements/report/."

# /hub-health — agent-hub health and token cost

Read-only on this project. No file changes here, no seal gate needed —
`--report` only writes into the agent-hub-init repo (step 6).

## Why this exists
`haven/diagrams/dev-loop.prime-mermaid.md` and `doctrine/domains/
PROJECT.md` are both read in full by every worker session (implementer,
verifier, and every subagent spawned for a `/todo` verify pass re-loads
them from scratch). Left unchecked either grows forever and becomes the
single biggest recurring token cost in the hub — this is what the
`dev-loop-archive.md` / `PROJECT-archive.md` conventions (see each file's
own header note) exist to bound. This command measures whether that's
actually happening, instead of guessing.

There's no exact tokenizer available here — the report uses `bytes / 4` as
a documented, consistent proxy (not a real token count). Good enough to
catch size regressions and compare categories; don't quote it as a real
billed-token number.

## Steps
1. Run this exact script from the repo root (adjust `ROOT` if invoked
   elsewhere — it defaults to the current directory):

```bash
ROOT="."
HUB="$ROOT/agent-hub"

bytes_glob() { find $1 -maxdepth "${2:-99}" -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" \) 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null | wc -c | tr -d ' '; }
bytes_glob_exclude() { find "$1" -type f \( -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" \) ! -iname "*archive*" ! -path "*/doctrine/features/*" 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} + 2>/dev/null | wc -c | tr -d ' '; }
row() { local label="$1" b="$2"; local t=$(( b / 4 )); printf "  %-40s %9d B  ~%8d tok\n" "$label" "$b" "$t"; }
check_threshold_bytes() {
  local label="$1" b="$2" threshold="$3" hint="$4"
  local kb=$(( threshold / 1024 ))
  if [ "$b" -gt "$threshold" ]; then
    echo "  ⚠ $label is ${b}B (>${kb}KB threshold) — $hint"
  else
    echo "  ✓ $label is ${b}B, under the ${kb}KB threshold"
  fi
}
check_threshold() {
  local file="$1" threshold="$2" hint="$3"
  [ -f "$file" ] || return
  local b; b=$(wc -c < "$file" | tr -d ' ')
  check_threshold_bytes "$(basename "$file")" "$b" "$threshold" "$hint"
}

1b. Transcripts (default window 30 days; `[days]` overrides). Reads
   Claude Code's own transcripts for this repo
   (`~/.claude/projects/<repo path, non-alphanumerics → ->/*.jsonl` plus
   each session's `subagents/*.jsonl`), so the numbers are what was
   actually billed — cache reads included, not `bytes / 4`. A subagent
   counts as verifier/analyst when its spawn description names that
   role. The transcript format is Claude Code's internal one, not a
   public API — a parse that finds nothing prints "(no …)" instead of
   guessing.

2. Report the output verbatim — don't paraphrase the numbers into prose,
   the table is already the report.
3. If a flag fires on `dev-loop.prime-mermaid.md`, `PROJECT.md`, or
   `worker-runs.log`, that's a real signal to do an archive pass (see
   `dev-loop-archive.md` / `PROJECT-archive.md` / `worker-runs-archive.log`'s
   own convention notes, or the equivalent header sections in the active
   files) — but this command itself never edits anything. Archiving is a
   separate, explicit action. [amended 2026-09-02] The diagram flag prints
   the exact rows to move (not just "consider moving nodes") — copy-paste
   is the whole remaining effort, so there's no excuse to defer it past the
   current session the way a vague warning invites. [amended 2026-10-24]
   That alone did not hold (3 production hubs at 89-175KB) — the real fix
   is `verify_seal` step 11 collapsing each row at SEAL time. A diagram
   flag now means a pre-rule backlog (one-time pass) or a verifier that
   skipped step 11 (check the latest verdict notes).
4. If a flag fires on one of the 5 static reference
   files (`MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `INDEX.md`, `standards/*.md`), that's
   NOT an archive signal — those files have no accumulating list and no
   defined archive destination by design. Treat it as an anomaly: read the
   file, find what's misplaced (a Correction that belongs in the worker's
   own `MEMORY.md`, a Decision that belongs in `PROJECT.md`, a recipe that
   belongs in `haven/workers/<wid>/recipes/`), and move it to its one
   correct home instead of inventing a new archive file for a file that
   was never meant to grow. [amended 2026-10-24] `standards/*.md` use a
   12KB threshold, not 8KB — a project-specific standard (e.g. a PDF-export
   spec) legitimately grows with the feature it encodes.
5. `doctrine/ as a whole` gets its own flag on top of
   the per-file ones above — `doctrine/` (root files + `domains/` +
   `standards/`, archives excluded) is the single biggest chunk of the
   recurring per-session cost and had no aggregate check before, only
   `PROJECT.md` individually. This flag has no archive file of its own —
   it's a router, not a destination: when it fires, re-read the per-file
   flags above to find which specific file actually grew, then apply
   *that* file's own convention (step 3's archive pass if it's
   `PROJECT.md`, step 4's anomaly triage if it's one of the 5 static
   files). Don't create a `doctrine-archive.md` for this flag — it exists
   to catch the case where several files each stayed under their own
   threshold but the directory's total still crept up.
5b. Spawn cost and token waste (step 1b) — each is a lead, not a verdict;
   read the run before blaming the hub:
   - REOPEN over ~20% → implementers hand off notes with gaps the
     `implement` step 10b checklist should catch; read the latest
     `reopen.md` notes for the repeating gap.
   - Verifier `re-ran commands` over ~20% → verifiers skip "Re-run
     scope" in `verify_seal.md` (default is audit-only).
   - Verifier `write/run` well above the per-session hub bytes / 4 →
     the verifier loads files outside its manifest `reads:`.
   - A re-read of a file under `agent-hub/` → a GUARD (`boot` step 2,
     `pick_next`, `verify_seal` step 3) was skipped. Re-reads of images
     or files edited in between are usually legitimate.
   - A failing command repeated ≥3x → the `implement` step 6b loop guard
     didn't fire, or the loop ran outside a worker pass.
   - Tool results >40k chars → a command dumped whole logs/files; cap it
     (`| tail`, `head`, `Read` with `limit`) in the recipe that ran it.
6. `--report <agent-hub-init path>`: write the step 1/1b output plus
   the step 3-5b findings into
   `<path>/improvements/report/<YYYY-MM-DD>-#<NN>-hub-health-<project>.md`
   — `<NN>` and the filename follow that repo's
   `.claude/rules/improvements-naming.md` (read it first; next number
   = highest `#` among `report/` filenames + 1, 2 digits). Sections:
   `- **Recorded:**`, `- **Context:**` (project, kit version from
   `agent-hub/.kit-version`, window), `- **Status:** unverified`,
   `## Baseline` (output verbatim), `## Findings` (numbered: what,
   evidence line from the output, suggested kit change — only for
   flags that fired), `## Not checked`. No path given → ask for it, don't
   guess. Never write anything into this project's own files.

## If this hub uses epic sharding
If `haven/diagrams/index.md` exists (opt-in, see
`kit/agent-hub-templates.md` §9️⃣.3), `DIAG_ACTIVE_B` above sums bytes
across **every** `dev-loop-<epic>.prime-mermaid.md`, not just the one(s)
marked `active: true`. Treat "haven/diagrams/ (active file only)" as an
**upper bound** in that case, not the real per-session cost — `/boot` and
`pick_next` only read the active epic file(s) + `index.md`, per
`boot.md` step 5. This script doesn't parse `index.md`'s `active` column
(keeping it a plain byte-counting script, not a markdown-table parser) —
if you need the real per-session number under sharding, sum
`index.md` + only the active epic file(s) by hand.

## What the numbers mean
- **Recurring per-session cost** — what a fresh implementer or verifier
  worker reads before touching any code. This is the number that actually
  compounds: every subagent spawned for a verify pass pays it again, from
  zero, with no cache reuse across separate agent contexts.
- **Cold storage** — `evidence/`, `doctrine/features/` (1 doc opened
  per task via its INDEX), and archived rows from the diagram,
  `PROJECT.md`, and `worker-runs.log`. Large here is normal and not itself
  a problem: `/boot` and `pick_next` only touch a handful of the most
  recent evidence notes, not the whole directory. Only worth worrying
  about if something starts reading it in bulk (e.g. a recipe that globs
  all of `evidence/` instead of the specific notes it needs).

- **Billed tokens** — `write/run` is the cold load each
  spawn pays (the bundle + doctrine read from zero); `in/run` is the
  whole run, cache re-reads included, so it grows with every tool call
  the run makes. A verifier's `write/run` rising over time = the hub
  files it loads grew; `in/run` rising with flat `write/run` = it makes
  more calls per verdict (re-running commands, reading beyond the note).

## Runtime
`/hub-health [days] [--report <agent-hub-init path>]`. Read-only on this
project — no seal gate, no evidence note, no worker identity needed (this
isn't a code-repo change). `--report` writes only into agent-hub-init.
